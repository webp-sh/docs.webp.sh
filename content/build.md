# Build WebP Server Go

Install latest version of golang, enable go module, install dependencies described under [Usage with Binary(Advanced)](/usage/usage-with-binary/) and clone the repo, then...

```sh
make
```

**Due to the limitations of webp module, you can't cross compile this tool. 
But the binary will work instantly on your platform and arch**
