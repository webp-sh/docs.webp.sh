# Update

There are two update methods.

## Auto update

When running WebP Server Go(version > 0.1.0), it will automatically detect newer versions of the program, and download them to the `update` folder in the same folder of the current program, you can replace current running program to the newer one and have a restart to use the newer version.

## Manual update

Just download our latest program from [Releases · webp-sh/webp_server_go · GitHub](https://github.com/webp-sh/webp_server_go/releases), replace the program and give it a restart.
