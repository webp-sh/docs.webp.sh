This is a Server based on Golang, which allows you to serve WebP images on the fly. 
It will convert `jpg,jpeg,png` files by default, this can be customized by editing the `config.json`.
* currently supported image format: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, SVG

>
> ~~For Safari and Opera users, the original image will be used.~~
> We've now supported Safari/Chrome/Firefox on iOS 14/iPadOS 14
